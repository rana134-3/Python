    "# Q.1 What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, \n",
    "disrupting the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional situation is encountered, \n",
    "the Python interpreter raises an exception. It is a way for Python to handle errors and \n",
    "unexpected situations in a structured and controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for various reasons, such as trying to perform an invalid operation, \n",
    "accessing an undefined variable, dividing by zero, or attempting to open a non-existent file. \n",
    "When an exception is raised, it can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, \n",
    "allowing the program to gracefully recover from the error or take appropriate action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between Syntax Errors and Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "    1. Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur when the Python interpreter \n",
    "    encounters incorrect syntax in the code.\n",
    "    2. These errors are raised during the parsing phase, before the program is executed.\n",
    "    3. Common syntax errors include missing colons, incorrect indentation, mismatched parentheses, etc.\n",
    "    4. Syntax errors prevent the program from running and must be fixed before the program can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a syntax error:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Missing colon after the 'if' statement\n",
    "    if x > 10\n",
    "        print(\"x is greater than 10\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "    1. Exceptions occur during the execution of the program when an unexpected situation arises.\n",
    "    2. These errors are not necessarily detected during the parsing phase; they can occur during \n",
    "    runtime when specific conditions are met.\n",
    "    3. Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, TypeError, ValueError, FileNotFoundError, etc.\n",
    "    4. Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, \n",
    "    allowing the program to recover gracefully and continue execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of an exception:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        x = 10 / 0  # Division by zero raises a ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError as e:\n",
